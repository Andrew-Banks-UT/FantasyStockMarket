# Section 1: Introduction 

Merchant Sim 1434 is an incremental/idle game that blends classic clicker-style progression with a simulated market. 
Though plenty of incremental/idle games have been done before, ours has the unique angle of allowing the player to 
trade their earned rewards in a simulated market that takes inspiration from real world stock trading. Our team 
collectively has an interest in gaming and  a curiosity of game development, and is eager to try our hand at it 
using the software design process. 
We’re defining ‘incremental/idle game’ as a genre in which players are presented with passive, simple decisions 
that incrementally progress the gameplay. In our case, players begin with a small amount of money and earning 
potential and through passive and simple interactions are able to grow their worth and spend this money to unlock 
new features. The simulated market serves to multiply the player’s earned capital, allowing the player to invest 
and speculate, eventually attaining digital exuberance.


# Section 2: Customer Value 
Who is the primary customer?
* The primary customer is the general public (whoever wants to play our game).

What does the customer want?
* The customer wants entertainment.

Why? What is their underlying problem to solve or experience to have?
* They are bored. want to experience a fantasy world with quests, and invest in the market with no real risks.

Place your software in the context of the market.
* Our game stands out from other idle games because of its unique market element.

Proposed Solution:
From the customer’s POV, what will your solution deliver?
* Our game will solve the customers boredom and allow customers to invest in the market with no real world risks.

How will the customer benefit from your proposed solution?
* They will no longer be bored. 

Does it provide a new capability or is it much better, easier, faster …?
* It provides a unique experience by introducing the player to a stock market in a fantasy setting.

Have you tested the idea on anyone?
* We have tested the idea on at least one person, and they liked it .

Measures of Success:
How will you know if customers got the benefits you want to provide?
* We could create a feedback system or ask for reviews of our game.

What are your customer-centric measures of success?
* Five star reviews are a measure of success.

# Section 3: Tech

From the developer’s POV, what will your software do?
* Simulate a stock market
* Simulate idle game components

What are the main components of your system? What do they do?
* Trading: buy and sell stocks on a simulated stock market.
* Quests that are completed over time that provide the player with rewards

What is a high-level block diagram of the architecture of the system?
* Idle game -> money <-> Stock market

What is a minimal system that would have some value to the customer?
* A weak simulation of the stock market.

What are some possible enhancements that customers would value?
* Post game content, rich story, worldbuilding, raids.

How will you test your system?
* Playing the game. Getting others to play test to reduce personal bias.

What will you use to build the system?
* HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Are there available tools you can leverage?
* jQuery

# Section 4: Team
Skills:
Has anybody on the team built something like this before?
* No, this is a new experience for all of us.

Are the tools known or new to the team?
* Most of the tools are new to the team, although some may be familiar to some of us.

Roles:
We will be rotating roles.
* Narrative/Design
* Interface
* Research
* Software Design
* Project Management

# Section 5: Project Management 
Schedule:
Is completion  of the system feasible?
* Yes. If the team keeps to a tight schedule, completion of the project is feasible. Our basic idea is not very complicated, but we hope to implement more features, time allowing. 

When and how often will you meet? 
* We will mostly meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays before and after classes on Discord.

Create a tentative schedule: 
* Week 1: Draft the proposal. Research stock market to design a good replicate system.
* Week 2: Revise project proposal. Get the team acclimated to new technologies.
* Week 3: Work on the project. Get basic infrastructure up and running.
* Week 4: Finish first draft of the software. Create a status report.
* Week 5: Implement quest system and touch up stock market system. Improve user interface.
* Week 6: Finish second draft. Create a second status report.
* Week 7: Analyze where we are at in the project and determine what features can be feasibly added.
* Week 8: Finish 3rd draft. Create a third status report.
* Week 9: Continue to add additional features while fine tuning the other systems. Improve user interface.
* Week 10: Finish final draft. Write a project report.

Constraints:
Are there any regulatory, or legal constraints? 
* We will have to look into potential copyright issues with the title of our game and potential patents that exist.

Are there any ethical or social concerns? 
* We must be clear that our game is in no way like the real stock market and does not offer financial advice.

Resources:
Will you have access  to the data you need? 
* Yes. Our game will not run off of real stocks, so the only thing the team needs is a basic understanding of the market.

Descoping:
What will happen  if the full functionality can not be implemented. 
* If the full functionality can not be achieved then we will cut out the quest/raid portion of the game and leave it as a basic stock market game.

Will the reduced functionality operate? 
* Yes, the reduced functionality will operate.

Will it be useful (at least partially solving the problem)? 
* The game will still be playable, but it may be a bit basic/less engaging if the quest system is removed.
