# Section 1: Introduction 

Merchant Sim 1434 is an incremental/idle game that blends classic clicker-style progression with a simulated market. 
Though plenty of incremental/idle games have been done before, ours has the unique angle of allowing the player to 
trade their earned rewards in a simulated market that takes inspiration from real world stock trading. Our team 
collectively has an interest in gaming and  a curiosity of game development, and is eager to try our hand at it 
using the software design process. 
We’re defining ‘incremental/idle game’ as a genre in which players are presented with passive, simple decisions 
that incrementally progress the gameplay. In our case, players begin with a small amount of money and earning 
potential and through passive and simple interactions are able to grow their worth and spend this money to unlock 
new features. The simulated market serves to multiply the player’s earned capital, allowing the player to invest 
and speculate, eventually attaining digital exuberance.

Roles:
We will be rotating roles.

# Section 5: Project Management 
Schedule:
We believe that if the team keeps to a tight schedule, completion of the project is feasible. Our basic idea is not very complicated, but we hope to implement more features, time allowing. We will mostly meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays before and after classes on Discord to discuss the project's progress and give eachother updates. We can also communicate on the text section of discord at all hours of the day to ask for help or discuss things.

###### Schedule:
| Week         | Task |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | Draft the proposal. Research stock market to design a good replicate system. |
| 2 | Revise project proposal. Get the team acclimated to new technologies. |
| 3 | Work on the project. Get basic infrastructure up and running. |
| 4 | Finish first draft of the software. Create a status report. |
| 5 | Implement quest system and touch up stock market system. Improve user interface. |
| 6 | Finish second draft. Create a second status report. |
| 7 | Analyze where we are at in the project and determine what features can be feasibly added. |
| 8 | Finish 3rd draft. Create a third status report. |
| 9 | Continue to add additional features while fine tuning the other systems. Improve user interface. |
| 10| Finish final draft. Write a project report. |


We will have to look into potential copyright issues with the title of our game and potential patents that exist. We must be clear that our game is in no way like the real stock market and does not offer financial advice. Our game will not run off of real stocks, so the only thing the team needs is a basic understanding of the market. If the full functionality can not be achieved then we will cut out the quest/raid portion of the game and leave it as a basic stock market game. The reduced functionality will operate, but it may be a bit basic/less engaging if the quest system is removed.
