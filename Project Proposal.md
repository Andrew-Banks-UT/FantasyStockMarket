# Section 1: Introduction 

Merchant Sim 1434 is an incremental/idle game that blends classic clicker-style progression with a simulated market. 
Though plenty of incremental/idle games have been done before, ours has the unique angle of allowing the player to 
trade their earned rewards in a simulated market that takes inspiration from real world stock trading. Our team 
collectively has an interest in gaming and  a curiosity of game development, and is eager to try our hand at it 
using the software design process. 
We’re defining ‘incremental/idle game’ as a genre in which players are presented with passive, simple decisions 
that incrementally progress the gameplay. In our case, players begin with a small amount of money and earning 
potential and through passive and simple interactions are able to grow their worth and spend this money to unlock 
new features. The simulated market serves to multiply the player’s earned capital, allowing the player to invest 
and speculate, eventually attaining digital exuberance.


# Section 2: Customer Value 

The primary customer for Merchant Sim 1434 is the general public (whoever wants to play our game), and our customers 
seek entertainment. While their underlying problem to be solved is boredom, our customerts also want to experience a 
fatasy world with quests and invest in a market without any real risks. Our software in the context of the real 
world market shows that our game stands out from other idle games becuase of its unique market element. 
From the customer's point-of-view, our solution will solve the customers' boredom and allow customers to invest in
the market with no real world monetary liabilites. The customer will also benefit from our proposed solution as 
they will no longer be bored and will instead be entertained. Additionally, our game provides a unique experience
by introducting the player to a stock market in a fantasy setting. We have already tested the idea on at least one 
person, and they were interested. 
We could know if customers got the benefits we want to provide by creating a feedback system or asking for reviews 
of our game. Our customer-centric measures of success are five star reviews.

# Section 3: Tech

From the developer’s POV, what will your software do?
* Simulate a stock market
* Simulate idle game components

What are the main components of your system? What do they do?
* Trading: buy and sell stocks on a simulated stock market.
* Quests that are completed over time that provide the player with rewards

What is a high-level block diagram of the architecture of the system?
* Idle game -> money <-> Stock market

What is a minimal system that would have some value to the customer?
* A weak simulation of the stock market.

What are some possible enhancements that customers would value?
* Post game content, rich story, worldbuilding, raids.

How will you test your system?
* Playing the game. Getting others to play test to reduce personal bias.

What will you use to build the system?
* HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Are there available tools you can leverage?
* jQuery

# Section 4: Team
Skills:
Has anybody on the team built something like this before?
* No, this is a new experience for all of us.

Are the tools known or new to the team?
* Most of the tools are new to the team, although some may be familiar to some of us.

Roles:
We will be rotating roles.
* Narrative/Design
* Interface
* Research
* Software Design
* Project Management

# Section 5: Project Management 
Schedule:
We believe that if the team keeps to a tight schedule, completion of the project is feasible. Our basic idea is not very complicated, but we hope to implement more features, time allowing. We will mostly meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays before and after classes on Discord to discuss the project's progress and give eachother updates. We can also communicate on the text section of discord at all hours of the day to ask for help or discuss things.

###### Schedule:
| Week         | Task |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | Draft the proposal. Research stock market to design a good replicate system. |
| 2 | Revise project proposal. Get the team acclimated to new technologies. |
| 3 | Work on the project. Get basic infrastructure up and running. |
| 4 | Finish first draft of the software. Create a status report. |
| 5 | Implement quest system and touch up stock market system. Improve user interface. |
| 6 | Finish second draft. Create a second status report. |
| 7 | Analyze where we are at in the project and determine what features can be feasibly added. |
| 8 | Finish 3rd draft. Create a third status report. |
| 9 | Continue to add additional features while fine tuning the other systems. Improve user interface. |
| 10| Finish final draft. Write a project report. |


We will have to look into potential copyright issues with the title of our game and potential patents that exist. We must be clear that our game is in no way like the real stock market and does not offer financial advice. Our game will not run off of real stocks, so the only thing the team needs is a basic understanding of the market. If the full functionality can not be achieved then we will cut out the quest/raid portion of the game and leave it as a basic stock market game. The reduced functionality will operate, but it may be a bit basic/less engaging if the quest system is removed.
